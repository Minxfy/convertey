              Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or
              mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to
              make websites work more efficiently and provide information to the
              owners of the site. They can store information about your browsing
              activity on a particular website, such as your preferences, login
              details, or items in your shopping cart. There are different types
              of cookies, each serving a specific purpose. For example,
              &quot;session cookies&quot; are temporary and expire when you
              close your browser, while &quot;persistent cookies&quot; remain on
              your device for a specified period.
